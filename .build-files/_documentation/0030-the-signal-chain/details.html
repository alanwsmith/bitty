TODO: Add note about there not being error messages
for missing send/receive functions because elements
can be nested. bitty-COMPONENT_VERSION would have to be updated
to look for nested functions explicitly where
the only purpose was to add error messages. 
That's more overhead than I want to add at this
point. It's under consideration for future
updates.

#### TODO

- original signals stop at the bounds of the
component but a `bittyhoist` signal is
bubbled up. 

#### Signal Chain Overview

When an monitored event (e.g. click or input) 
occurs on an element with a __data-send__
attribute, the value is used to 
determine signal names which are then
fired. 

When signals are received, __bitty-COMPONENT_VERSION__
components gathers all child elements 
with a corresponding __data-receive__
attribute and runs them through
the JavaScript module function 
with the same name. 

For example, given:

<pre class="code-block">
  [!- filter highlight_html|safe -!]
<bitty-COMPONENT_VERSION data-connect="/modules/example.js">
  <button data-send="update">Click Me</button>
  <div data-receive="update"></div>
</bitty-COMPONENT_VERSION>
  [! endfilter !]
</pre>

<pre class="code-block">
  [!- filter highlight_javascript|safe -!]
export default class {
  update(el, event) {
    el.innerHTML = `Got x from x`
  }
}
  [!- endfilter -!]
</pre>

[!- endfilter -!]
