### Version: 1.0.0-rc3

Sept. 23, 2025

- Fixed bug where `this.api.send()` would update the
`data-send` attribute on the original element so
it no longer send the same signal. The method
is now called `this.api.forward()`.

- Removed `data-watch`. Any element
can receive a signal from anywhere else on the
page without extra overhead. The biggest
negative to this approach is that you have
to be a little more careful to avoid naming
collisions. But, the ease of use is well
worth that minor trade off.

- Added Test Suite Results Report to site 
for easier viewing.

- Applying passed and failed colors to 
individual tests for quicker scanning.

- Updated tests to use unique signal
names to avoid collisions.
