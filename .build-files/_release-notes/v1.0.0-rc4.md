### Version: 1.0.0-rc4

DATE: TBD

- Renamed `<bitty-js>` component tag to 
`<bitty-MAJOR_VERSION>` for semantic versioning. 

- Call `bittyInit()` with `await`
if it's an `async` function. 

- Moved `bittyInit()` before the `data-send`
calls from the component so the module
can set things up before the signals 
start being sent.

- Allowing `this.api.forward()` to be called
with a `null` event (e.g. 
`this.api.forward(null, "anotherFunction");`). 
This is done to allow things like forwarding
a signal from `bittyInit()` or any other
function where there isn't an event to pass
along.

- Fixed bug where new receivers weren't
being added properly when they were child
nodes of new nodes being added (and
the top layer didn't have a `data-` attr
in it)

- Added tests for `this.api.querySelector()`
and `document.querySelector()`

- Update site to use variables for version
numbers to make them easier to maintain
instead of having them in multiple places
for different displays. 

- Made `this.metadata` an object and
moved `version` into it (along with
`copyright` and `license`)
