### Version: 1.1.0-rc1

DATE: TBD

- `<bitty-1-1>` can be called
without a `data-connect` attribute. When it is, 
it looks for a `window.BittyClass` on the 
page and uses it if it's available. 

- Removed .error() method in favor of
calling `console.error()` directly in order
to get useful line numbers.
