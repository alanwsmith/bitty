### Version: 3.0.0-rc1

DATE: TBD

- Renamed `this.api.useHTML()` to 
`this.api.makeEl()` (which returns an Element)
to avoid confusion with
`this.api.getHTML()` (which returns a
Document Fragment).

- Added `connectedMoveCallback()` to 
prevent `connectedCallback()` from firing
if a component is moved

- Moved everything in the init
into the conditional check to see if 
the component makes a connection to a class. 
Previous a few things happend prior to 
the connection attempt. Moving them in
prevents UUIDs from being added until
a conneciton has been made. 


- TODO: When returning values from fetches
return an object with either `{ ok: PAYLOAD }`, 
or `{ error: { text: ERROR_TEXT } }` with 
extra data coming down in the error object
like status codes for HTML errors. 

- TODO: Added test to verify events
have UUIDs added to them. 


- TODO: Added a `getEl` that gets a single
HTML element instead of a document fragment
like `getHTML` does


- TODO: Added ingestion of fucntions from 
the module js files into `this.api.fn`. 
If there are naming collisions the order
last one in the chain of `[@ config.tag_name @]`,
`window.bittyFunctions`, module function
exports wins.
