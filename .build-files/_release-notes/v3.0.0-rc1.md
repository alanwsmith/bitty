### Version: 3.0.0-rc1

DATE: TBD


- TODO: rename `useHTML` to `makeEl` when
the next breaking change bump to v3.x.x happens


- TODO: When returning values from fetches
return an object with either `{ ok: PAYLOAD }`, 
or `{ error: { text: ERROR_TEXT } }` with 
extra data coming down in the error object
like status codes for HTML errors. 


- TODO: Added a `getEl` that gets a single
HTML element instead of a document fragment
like `getHTML` does


- TODO: Added ingestion of fucntions from 
the module js files into `this.api.fn`. 
If there are naming collisions the order
last one in the chain of `[@ config.tag_name @]`,
`window.bittyFunctions`, module function
exports wins. 


- TODO: Set up the `bitty` tag to listen
for signals with `data-receive` to allow
for things like completely switching out
the contents of the component without
having to rely on a child element calling
`.parentNode`. 

- TODO: Added `usePageTemplate()` that pulls
a template from the overall page via
a query selector.

- TODO: Added `connectedMoveCallback()` to 
prevent `connectedCallback()` from firing
if a component is moved

- TODO: Moved everything in the init
into the conditional check to see if 
the component makes a connection to a class. 
Previous a few things happend prior to 
the connection attempt. Moving them in
prevents UUIDs from being added until
a conneciton has been made. 

- TODO: Added test to verify events
have UUIDs added to them. 


- TODO: Added `await:signal` to `data-send`
and `this.api.forward(event, "signal")`
to await async methods
