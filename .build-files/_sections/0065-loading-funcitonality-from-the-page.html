__bitty-v1-rc5__ can use `<script>` tags on
the page for functinoality. For example,
this `<script>` is in the `<head>` element
of this page:

<pre class="code-block">
[@ highlight_file("_inline_scripts/main-example-script.html")|safe @]
</pre>

Using it is done by setting the __data-connect__
attribute of a __bitty-v1-rc5__ to the name of
the class in the __bittyClasses__ object:

<pre class="code-block">
[@ highlight_file("_inline_scripts/main-example-html.html")|safe @]
</pre>

Here's what it looks like:

[! include "_inline_scripts/main-example-html.html" !]

[! endfilter !]
