  <summary>Designed for Simplicity</summary>

[! filter markdown|safe !]
The goal is to make adding reactivity to sites
and pages as simple as possible. To wit,
**bitty-COMPONENT_VERSION** is:

- A single file web component
- Written in vanilla JavaScript
- Powered by standard HTML attributes
- Stylable via the light DOM
- Designed for both progressive enhancement and API based content loading

The result:

- No build step required. 
- CSS selectors work like they do on regular elements. 
- __data-* attributes__ are the only things used in
the HTML. 
- Functionality is defined with native JavaScript functions.
