    This section is currently at the level of draft/scratch notes. Expect some
    duplication and possibly conflicting items.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      [] TODO: confirm top level bitty-1-1 element can be taken completely out of
      the receiver loop. that would mean they don't need inert/ignore/include
      which could be dropped from the API. (could always use a hidden element if
      there's something that needs to be handled inside a compoenent that's not
      covered by another element
    </li>
    <li>
      [] loadReactors is an event that bubbles so all ancestors can reload.
    </li>
    <li>
      [] <code>data-include</code> attr for elements. Only the signals named in
      it are reacted to. All others are ignored. TBD on interaction with
      <code>data-ignore</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      [] An empty <code>data-include</code> in one way to turn off all
      reactions.
    </li>
    <li>
      [] <code>data-inert</code> attr is an explicit way to turn off all
      reactions.
    </li>
    <li>[x] Exlicity defined error codes with individualized help messages.</li>
    <li>
      [x] All reactive elements have unique IDs that can be used for control and
      debugging.
    </li>
    <li>
      [x] Using <code>data-ignore</code> on elements tells it to ignore specific
      signals.
    </li>
    <li>
      [] Each element is checked to make sure it's still set up to react to a
      given signal every time it receives one before the update occurs.
    </li>
    <li>[] All reactive elements have unique ids.</li>
    <li>
      [] Name-spaced signals (i.e. signals with the format
      <code>NAMESPACE:SIGNAL</code>) are broadcast globally.
    </li>
    <li>
      [] Elements can receive name-spaced signals regardless of their
      relationship to the broadcaster.
    </li>
    <li>[] Error CSS class added to elements where errors occur.</li>
    <li>
      [] Built in debugger (TBD on specifics. Some stuff will happen
      automatically like a class being added to error elements. Thinking adding
      a watch for a <code>&debug</code> query param to add a close to show them
      is probably worth it).
    </li>
    <li>
      [] Rust level error message: It's a bug if an error message does give you
      enough information on how to fix it whatever caused it.
    </li>
    <li>[] Load template from the return value of a method call.</li>
    <li>[] Load template from a selector query on the parent page.</li>
    <li>[] Can nest multiple layers with everything becoming reactive.</li>
    <li>[] Improve error handling and messages.</li>
    <li>[] Automatically load templates.</li>
    <li>[x] Throttling done by <code>.requestAnimationFrame()</code>.</li>
    <li>[x] <code>data-call</code> to send functions for init.</li>
    <li>[x] <code>data-b</code> to send batches.</li>
    <li>[x] <code>data-batch</code> for the init version of batch send.</li>
    <li>[x] Parents can ignore children signals.</li>
    <li>[x] Parents can communicate with children through bridge.</li>
    <li>[x] Children can communicate with parents through bridge.</li>
    <li>[] Global senders.</li>
    <li>[] Global receivers.</li>
    <li>[] Query arbitrary instances for their data.</li>
    <li>[x] Call <code>.init()</code> on <code>Wires</code> if available.</li>
    <li>
      [x] bitty-1-1 init happens after wires init so send signals can be sent to
      templates the wires loads.
    </li>
    <li>
      [x] Loading a template automatically adds call/sender/receiver
      functionality to it.
    </li>
    <li>[] Load other web components.</li>
    <li>[] Loaded web components can use <code>bitty-1-1</code>.</li>
    <li>
      [x] Arbitrary <code>data-*</code> attributes can be used to send data to
      function calls.
    </li>
    <li>
      [] Send/receive functions can access data from the triggering event.
    </li>
    <li>
      [x] Core bitty.js functionality comes in the stand alone component.
      Specific behavior is defined by making a JavaScript module with a
      <code>Wires</code> class in it.
    </li>
    <li>[x] Based off a naming convention to wire everything together.</li>
    <li>[x] Multiple instances can be placed on a single page.</li>
    <li>
      [x] The component uses the light DOM. Page level CSS can be applied to
      content inside the wires.
    </li>
    <li>
      [x] Initialize data with <code>data-send</code> which does a send before
      the listeners are added.
    </li>
    <li>
      [x]: The <code>data-call</code> runs functions before doing the send
      events in <code>data-send</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      [x] Defaults to listening for <code>click</code> and
      <code>input</code> events.
    </li>
    <li>
      [x] Customize the event listeners with
      <code>data-listeners</code> in the <code>bitty-1-1</code> component tag.
    </li>
    <li>
      [x] CSS style variables/properties can be updated at the page/root level.
    </li>
    <li>
      [x] CSS style variables/properties can be updated scoped to the individual
      <code>bitty-1-1</code> element instance.
    </li>
    <li>[x] Classes can be updated.</li>
    <li>[x] .innerHTML can be updated.</li>
    <li>[x] .values can be updated.</li>
    <li>[] datasets can be updated.</li>
    <li>[] aria labels can be updated.</li>
    <li>
      [x] Can use <code>data-batch</code> and <code>data-b</code> for sending
      batches of signals.
    </li>
    <li>
      [x] The data-send attribute on the main component tag sends those signals
      at the start.
    </li>
    <li>
      [] Errors are thrown if the requested wires import doesn't exist or
      doesn't load.
    </li>
    <li>
      [] Preflight check to make sure functions exist and provide warnings if
      they don't.
    </li>
    <li>[] Stress test with increasing numbers of instances and updates.</li>
    <li>
      [] Send signals from internal functions in the wires? (e.g. a type of
      redirect).
    </li>
    <li>
      [] Defined, ID based error messages. Each message contains a description
      and, ideally help text.
    </li>
    <li>
      [] Documentation on adding custom errors from the tool classes (thinking
      they'll start with 9000 so they can be integers but be safe from
      collisions).
    </li>
    <li>
      [] Example of using <code>data-widget</code> to call something other than
      the default <code>Widget()</code> class.
    </li>
    <li>
      [x] Add a <code>bitty-component-error</code> class to components that have
      errors.
    </li>
    <li>
      [x] Add a <code>bitty-element-error</code> class to elements that have
      errors.
    </li>
    <li>
      [] Add a custom <code>bittyInit</code> event to <code>data-send</code>
      calls from the bitty element itself? Would send itself as a target
      so the behaviour would be the same for most purposes. This 
      would be considered a breaking change since the current test
      is to check if the event exists or not.
    </li>
