        is an appraoch to building on the web.  
        The core philosophy: provide content to as many people
        as possible. The device someone's using and the quality of
        their internet access shouldn't be barriers. In practice, 
        that means serving content in HTML. Styling and JavaScript 
        functionality provide later enhancements but aren't required.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>bitty-v1-rc4</strong> is a web component. Since web components
        require JavaScript, <strong>bitty-v1-rc4</strong> shouldn't
        be required to access the content it contains. Ensuring that
        is a key part of its design.
    </p>

    <h4>View and Enhance</h4>

    <p>
        This example provides two views of a list of books. 
        They both use this HTML:
    <p>

    <pre class="code-block large-block-margin"><code>
[!- autoescape false -!]
[@ data.misc_html["big-bookshelf-progressive-enhancement-header.html"].highlighted @]
[!- endautoescape -!]
[@- "\n" -@]
[!- autoescape false -!]
[@ data.misc_html["big-bookshelf-progressive-enhancement-include.html"].highlighted @]
[!- endautoescape -!]
[@- "\n" -@]
[!- autoescape false -!]
[@ data.misc_html["big-bookshelf-progressive-enhancement-footer.html"].highlighted @]
[!- endautoescape !]
</code></pre>

    <h4>What It's Like When bitty-v1-rc4 Fails</h4>

    <p>
        It's hard to describe how good modern web browers are. 
        They're nothing short of amazing. That helps ensure
        the functionality provided by <strong>bitty-v1-rc4</strong> 
        works for most people, most of the time. Unfortunatly, there's
        no way to guarantee it'll work 100% of the time. 
        Some reaons it might not include:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            A JavaScript error somewhere else on the page
            prevents <strong>bitty-v1-rc4</strong> from loading
        </li>
        <li>
            Something happens that prevents the <strong>bitty-v1-rc4</strong>
            file from downloading
        </li>
        <li>
            Something happens that prevents the module <strong>bitty-v1-rc4</strong>
            is trying to use from downloading
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Those issues are all centered around technical problems. Things
        that have gone wrong somewhere along the line. There's
        another category: Personal preference and contraints. 
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Some folks turn off JavaScript
        </li>
        <li>
            Some folks use devices that
            don't offer JavaScript at all
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Regardless of the reason, <strong>bitty-v1-rc4</strong> is desgined 
        so it can be used as a progressive enhancment. Here's what
        the book list HTML looks like if <strong>bitty-v1-rc4</strong>
        doesn't work:
