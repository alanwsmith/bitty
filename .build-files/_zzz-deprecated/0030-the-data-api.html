  __bitty-v1-rc4__ listens for. (The defaults are **click** and **input**.)

- **data-connect** - The path to the JavaScript
module responsible for providing functionality.

  _Required - Can only be used in **bitty-v1-rc4 elements**._

to receive signals. The value is the name of
the function that's used for the signal.

  _Standard - Only used in **child elements**._

from child elements when an event that's being
listened to occurs.

from below the element so signals can be set up
the DOM tree as well as down.
