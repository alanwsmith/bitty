**bitty-2-0** uses six __data-*__ attributes:

- **data-listeners** - Changes the events
  __bitty-2-0__ listens for. (The defaults are **click** and **input**.)

  _Optional - Can only be used in **bitty-2-0 elements**._

- **data-connect** - The path to the JavaScript
module responsible for providing functionality.

  _Required - Can only be used in **bitty-2-0 elements**._

- **data-receive** - Sets up child elements
to receive signals. The value is the name of
the function that's used for the signal.

  _Standard - Only used in **child elements**._

- **data-send** - Defines signals as
element sends. The value is the name of
the function that's used for the signal.

  Signals are sent from the **bitty-2-0** element 
when the component is initialized. They are sent
from child elements when an event that's being
listened to occurs.

  _Standard - Available in both **bitty-2-0 elements** and **child elements**._

- **data-use** - for using alternative
classes exported from the modules.

  _Optional - Can only be used in **bitty-2-0 elements**._

- **data-watch** - Watching for signals coming
from below the element so signals can be set up
the DOM tree as well as down.

  _Optional - Only used in **child elements**._
