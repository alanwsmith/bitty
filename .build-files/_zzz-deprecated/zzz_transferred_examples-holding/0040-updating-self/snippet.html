Updating An Element Directly

<!-- x -->

updating-self.js

<!-- x -->

- A single element can use both `data-send` and
`data-receive` with the same signal name/function to 
update itself in many cases. 
One exception is `input` elements. If they
try to update their own values when they change a 
feedback loop could be created. 

    See "Avoiding Feedback" below for one 
    approach to avoid that.
