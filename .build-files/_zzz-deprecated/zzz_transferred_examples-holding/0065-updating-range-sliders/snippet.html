Updating Range Sliders

- This is a one way update between sliders.
The output slider gets updated with the 
value of the input slider. But, the
input slider is not effected by changes
to the output slider. 

- Depending on the use case the
next example (Avoding Feedback) may be a 
better approach as it allows both
sliders to update their counterpart. 

- It's worth checking to see if 
throttling/debouncing is worth
implementing range sliders since
they can first a huge number
of events quickly. 

  I'll add an example in a future 
  release.
