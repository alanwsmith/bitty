A named class from an external module when the value
of `data-connect` is a path followed by a `|` then the
name of the class to look for. For example:



        <[@ config.tag_name @] data-connect="/some/module.js|AltExample"></[@ config.tag_name @]>

    looks for a file at `/some/module.js` with an exported class
    like

        export class AltExample {}
