<p>bitty looks in two places for functions to add to its
API in this order</p>

<ul>
<li>`const functions = {}` inside the `[@ config.script_min_file_name @]`
itself </li>
<li>`window.bittyFunctions = {}` on the parent page</li>
</ul>

<p>Any functions in those locations are added to 
`this.api.fn` that can be used inside signal methods.
These function calls use `.bind()` so that using
`this` inside them connects back to the
bitty component.
</p>

<p>NOTE: Functions will also be ingested from class modules
files in Version 3.</p>
