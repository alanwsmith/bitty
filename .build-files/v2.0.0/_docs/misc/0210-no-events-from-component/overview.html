<summary class="docs-summary">No Events From the Bitty Component</summary>
<p>
bitty components send a one time `bittytagdatasend` with signals from
a `data-send` attribute if one exists. Other than that, no
events from the bitty component itself are used. This
helps avoid duplication from events that would otherwise
bubble and trigger twice.
