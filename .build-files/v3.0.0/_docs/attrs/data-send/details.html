<h4>Sending Single Signals</h4>

<p>The `data-send` attribute defines which signals an
element sends when an event that's being listend for
fires.</p>

[! include config.version_dir + "/_docs/attrs/data-send/single/content.html" !]

<h4>Sending Multiple Signals</h4>

<p>
A single element can send multiple signals 
by separating them with a pipe (<code>|</code>)
in the `data-send` attribute:</p>

[! include config.version_dir + "/_docs/attrs/data-send/multiple/content.html" !]

<h4>Sending From the &lt;[@ config.tag_name @]&gt; tag</h4>

<p>A `data-send` attribute can be added to the
[@ config.tag_name @] component tag itself. It
create a custom `bittytagdatasend` event that 
only fires once after the component
has been initialized:</p>

[! include config.version_dir + "/_docs/attrs/data-send/from-bitty/content.html" !]

<h4>Sending Without Receivers</h4>

<p>If an event triggers a `data-send` signal
and there are no matching `data-receive`
elements, then the corresponding method
is fired once with a `null` value for
the element. For example:</p>

[! include config.version_dir + "/_docs/attrs/data-send/no-receivers/content.html" !]

<p>
This is useful when the number
of times an update needs to occur 
differers from the number of receiving
elements. For example, incrementing
by one works if a 
button is connected to only one
element with a matching `data-receive`
attribute: 
</p>

[! include config.version_dir + "/_docs/attrs/data-send/one-receiver/content.html" !]

<p>If there are multiple receivers, each
one increments the `#count` on its own. 
For example, every click of this button
adds one to each output so they end up 
with `1, 2, 3`, then `4, 5, 6`, etc...</p>

[! include config.version_dir + "/_docs/attrs/data-send/multiple-receivers/content.html" !]

<p>Sending an individual signal to do
the incrementing that isn't associated
with an `data-receive` elements followed
by a signal that _is_ connected to them
keeps them in sync</p>

<h4>async Signal Methods</h4>

<p>Signal Methods can be `async`</p>

[! include config.version_dir + "/_docs/attrs/data-send/async-send/content.html" !]

<p>(NOTE: There's currently not a way to do an `await` from
`data-send`. That's coming in a future release.)</p>
