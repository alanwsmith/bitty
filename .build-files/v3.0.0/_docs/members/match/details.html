<h4>Matching on UUIDs</h4>

<p>If no key is provided, then the automatically
generated UUIDs are used. One way this is useful
is determining if the element associated with
an event signal is also receiving the signal.
For example, all the buttons here send 
and receive the same `matchWithUUID` signal. 
Using `this.api.match()` is used to determine
which one was clicked:</p>
