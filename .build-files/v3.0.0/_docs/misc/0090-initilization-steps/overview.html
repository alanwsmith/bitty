<p>
When a web component (like bitty) is
attached to a page's DOM it fires a
`connectedCallback` event. bitty
uses the event to do the following
notable steps in this order:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    load supplemental function into `this.api.fn`.
  </li>
  <li>
    automatically generate `data-uuid` attributes
with unique IDs for the bitty element and 
all children elements if they don't
already exist.
  </li>
  <li>
    Attempt to make a connection to a supporting
class either on the page or in an external module file.
If the connection can't be made, an error is thrown
and the process stops. Otherwise, the following
steps are taken:
  </li>
  <li>
    Find any child elements with `data-receive` attributes
and add them to the internal list of receivers. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Add a mutation observer that watches for changes
and refreshes receivers when new elements are added
or removed. New elements also recive a `data-uuid`
if they don't already have one.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add event event listeners at the document level. 
The defaults are `click` and `input` but can be chagned
with a `data-listeners` attribute on the bitty component
tag. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Check for a `bittyInit()` method in the
  connected class and call it if it exists. (If
the method is defined with `async bittyInit()` it
is called with `await`.)
  </li>

  <li>
    Check for a `data-send` attribute on the
`bitty` component tag. Trigger it to send
its signals if it exists. The signal is
set with a type of `bittytagdatasend`.
The target is the bitty element itself. 
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
bitty this proceeds to listen for events
and send signals when they are triggered.
