  <summary>Docs - The HTML data-* API</summary>

<p>bitty sends signals to elements when
events occur. Defining the signals and the events
that trigger them is done with four <code>[! filter highlight_html|safe!]data-*[! endfilter !]</code>
attributes that are added to <code>[! filter highlight_html|safe!]<bitty-2-0>[! endfilter !]</code>
tags and their children. The four attributes are:</p>

  [! for attribute in docs.attributes !]
    <details>
      <summary class="docs-summary">[@ attribute.name @]</summary>
    [! include "v3.0.0/_docs/attrs/" + attribute.name + "/details.html" !]
    </details>
  [! endfor !]
