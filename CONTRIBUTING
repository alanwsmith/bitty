- I never want AI generated issues or code.
Don't submit either. 

- Opening issues is welcome after you've confirmed
it's not already in the _Features/TODO_, _Out-Of-Scope_
or _Known Bugs_ sections on the landing page at
https://bitty.alanwsmith.com/ 

- I'm not accepting code PRs right now. 
I'm still in the initial build out. Things
may jump around a lot. I'll open up to 
code PRs after the version 2.0 release. 

- I use my own site builder for the site
and tests. Getting set up with that will
take some work. It's not documented yet.
