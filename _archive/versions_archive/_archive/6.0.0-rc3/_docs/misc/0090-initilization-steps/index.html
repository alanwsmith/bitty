<p>
When a web component (like bitty) is
attached to a page's DOM it fires a
`connectedCallback` event. bitty
uses the event to do the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    automatically generate `data-bittyid` attributes
with unique IDs for the bitty element and 
all children elements if they don't
already exist.
  </li>
  <li>
    Attempt to make a connection to a supporting
class either on the page or in an external module file.
If the connection can't be made, an error is thrown
and the process stops. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Add event event listeners at the `window` level. 
The defaults are `click` and `input` but can be changed
with a `data-listeners` attribute on the bitty component
tag. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Check for a `bittyInit()` method in the
  connected class and call it if it exists. (If
the method is defined with `async bittyInit()` it
is called with `await`.)
  </li>
    <li>
      Process any elements with `data-init`
      attributes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Check for `bittyReady()` on the connected
      class and run it if it exists. (If
the method is defined with `async bittyInit()` it
is called with `await`.)

    </li>


</ul>
