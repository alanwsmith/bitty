<h4>Next Steps</h4>

<p>
  The example in the overview used a <code>button</code> with
  a <code>data-send</code> attribute and a separate <code>div</code>
  with a <code>data-receive</code> attribute. Here, we're using
  a single button with both <code>data-send</code> and <code>data-receive</code>.
  No extra work is required for most elements to
  both send and receive the same signal.

<p>
There are some cases (like [@ highlight_code('<input type="range">', "html")|safe @] elements)
where you have to add check to prevent feedback. <strong>bitty</strong>
provides helper funtions including one called <code>match</code>
to cover that. Check out the <code>Docs</code> sections
below for details. You can also check out the <code>Test Suite</code>.
Each test includes its source code that work as their own
examples as well.
