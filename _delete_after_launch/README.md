## Building The Site

The site is built from the built-in rust binary:

directory with Rust installed:

cargo build --release

Then you can run the watcher script:





## Notes

- All the example .js files are sitting at the root
of the site. I don't normally work that way,
but it makes the examples cleaner since the
paths are shorter.
