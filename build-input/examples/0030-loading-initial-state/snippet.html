Loading Initial State

loading-initial-state.js

<!-- x -->

- The initial value is set as and
stored in a `#counter`
[private element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/Private_elements)
on initilization. 

- `data-send` is used on the `bitty-js` element to
send the `displayCount` signal which is picked
up by the `div` to show the initial `#counter` value
when the component is initialize. 

- The button uses `data-call` to trigger the
`increment` function that updates the `#counter`
variable before any signals are sent. 

- `data-send` on the button 
triggers the `displayCount` signal and 
corresponding function when the
button is clicked.
