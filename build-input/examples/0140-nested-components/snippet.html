Nested Component Event Issolation

<!-- x -->

nested-parent.js

<!-- x -->

- bitty is designed to work with the
light DOM, but provides some encapsulation. 
Specifically, event propigation (aka bubbling)
doesn't go beyond the element. 

- Note that I'm intentionally using
`increment` as the `data-call`
for both the parent and the nested elements. 
This is to demonstrate they remain issolated
even though they have the same name. 

  A better approach would be to have different
  names (e.g. `incrementParent`
  and `incrementNested`) to avoid
  confusion. 

  That issolation doesn't not extend to the
  `data-send`/`data-receive`
  attributes as seen in the next example.
