  <p>Data attribute naming update for clarity</p>
  <ul> 
    <li>
      The biggest update is changing <code>data-b</code>, <code>data-c</code>,
      <code>data-r</code>, and <code>data-s</code> to <code>data-batch</code>, 
      <code>data-call</code>, <code>data-recieve</code>, and <code>data-send</code>,
      respectivally. I originally use the shorter names to reduce the text
      length. The increased clarity of the longer names is worth the
      few extra characters.
    </li>
    <li>
      The other big change is removing the leading <code>_</code> and
      <code>$</code> characters from function names. They were originally 
      put in place to create a naming convention that differentiated
      between functions that were hit with <code>data-call</code>
      and <code>data-send</code>. In practice, that wasn't necessary.
    </li>
    <li>
      Wrote up the API. I knew there were only four attributes that define the
      reactivity on elements but it's really cool to see sunch a small list
      written out.
    </li>
    <li>
      Split the web site page up into individual template for sections. Much
      nicer to work with
    </li>
    <li>
      TODO: Confrim inert/include/ignore can be dropped from the top level
      components then remove them.
    </li>
    <li>
      TODO: Confirm async/await stuff can be done directly with functions and
      there doesn't need to be anything specific added to the element signals to
      acommodate them (i.e. elements shouldn't have to know or make a decision
      about if something needs to be called async)
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>
