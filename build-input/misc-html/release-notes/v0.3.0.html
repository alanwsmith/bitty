  <p>Data attribute naming update for clarity</p>
  <ul> 
    <li>
      The biggest update is changing <code>data-b</code>, <code>data-c</code>,
      <code>data-r</code>, and <code>data-s</code> to <code>data-batch</code>, 
      <code>data-call</code>, <code>data-receive</code>, and <code>data-send</code>,
      respectivally. I originally use the shorter names to reduce the text
      length. The increased clarity of the longer names is worth the
      few extra characters.
    </li>
    <li>
      The other big change is removing the leading <code>_</code> and
      <code>$</code> characters from function names. They were originally 
      put in place to create a naming convention that differentiated
      between functions that were hit with <code>data-call</code>
      and <code>data-send</code>. In practice, that wasn't necessary.
    </li>
    <li>
      Removed the <code>data-batch</code> attribute. While there are some use 
      cases where it might be nice, the extra complexity, mental overhead, and maintance 
      aren't worth it.
    </li>
    <li>
      Added Mutation Observer so data-* functionaltiy works
      on elements that are added after initilization.
    </li>
    <li>
      Added documentation to each of the examples. (Documention is 
      stored as markdown direclty in the example files.)
    </li>
    <li>
      Split the web site page up into individual template for sections. Much
      nicer to work with.
    </li>
    <li>
      Updated example functions to always use <code>(el, _event)</code> instead
      of <code>(el, _)</code> for clarity. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Removed inert/include/ignore can be dropped from the top level
      components then remove them. This was originally a way to tell 
      parent components to ignore specific calls and signals from children. 
      After using it a bit, I don't think the complexity is worth it. 
      Better to just name functions an signals so they don't collide.
    </li>
    <li>
      TODO: Confirm async/await stuff can be done directly with functions and
      there doesn't need to be anything specific added to the element signals to
      acommodate them (i.e. elements shouldn't have to know or make a decision
      about if something needs to be called async)
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>
