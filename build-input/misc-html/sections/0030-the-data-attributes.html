<summary>The data-* Attributes</summary>

  <p>
    The bitty API is comprised of N <code>data-*</code> attributes.
    They are:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>data-call</strong> - Calls a function without
        sending a signal. These calls are made prior
        to any signals being sent. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Can be used in either the <code>bitty-js</code> element
        itself or any child elements.
      <p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>data-listeners</strong> - Adds additional 
        event listeners to the component. (The 
        defaults are <code>click</code>, <code>input</code>,
        and <code>change</code>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Only used by the <code>bitty-js</code> element itself. 
      <p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>data-module</strong> - The path to the JavaScript
        module responsible for providing functionality for
        the bitty-js component and its elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only used by the <code>bitty-js</code> element
        itself.
      <p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>data-receive</strong> - Sets up child elements
        to receive signals. The value is the name of
        the funciton that's used for the signal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only used by child elements.
      <p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>data-send</strong> - Defines signals for the
        element to send. The value is the name of
        the funciton that's used for the signal.
      </p>
      <p>Signals are sent from the <code>bitty-js</code> element 
        when the component is initialized. They are sent  
        from child elements when one of their event listeners
        fires. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Can be used in either the <code>bitty-js</code> element
        itself or any child elements.
      <p>
    </li>


    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>data-use</strong> - for using alternaive
        classes exported from the modules
      <p>
    </li>


    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>data-watch</strong> - Watching for signals coming
        from below the element so signals can be set up
        the DOM tree as well as down.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only used by child elements.
      <p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    bitty is really just wiring between elements and
    functions in the module called by <code>data-bridge</code>.
    The Examples below provide more documentation
    and details on how bitty works.
