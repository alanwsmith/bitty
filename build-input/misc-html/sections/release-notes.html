      <h3>Version: 0.2.4</h3>
      <p>DATE TBD</p>

      [! include "wrapper/do-not-edit-output-reminder.html" !]

      <p>TODO: write a short note about what's covered in this release</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Wrote up the API. I knew there were only four attributes that define
          the reactivity on elements but it's really cool to see sunch a small
          list written out.
        </li>
        <li>
          TODO: Confrim inert/include/ignore can be dropped from the top level
          components then remove them.
        </li>
        <li>
          TODO: Confirm async/await stuff can be done directly with functions
          and there doesn't need to be anything specific added to the element
          signals to acommodate them (i.e. elements shouldn't have to know or
          make a decision about if something needs to be called async)
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

      <h3>Version: 0.2.3</h3>
      <p>June 5, 2025</p>

      [! include "wrapper/do-not-edit-output-reminder.html" !]

      <p>Lots of error handling work in this one.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Moved UUID generation for the <code>bitty-js</code> and all
          <code>data-*</code> reactive elements to the first thing in
          <code>connectedCallback()</code> to aid in error messaging.
        </li>
        <li>
          Made <code>connectedCallback()</code> and <code>async</code> function
          to throw loading the widget module into its own funcitoun
        </li>
        <li>
          Created an <code>#errors</code> private var to store error messages
          and help by ID.
        </li>
        <li>Added the first few error messages</li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Added <code>this.error()</code> for outputting errors. It takes two
            optional arguments: an ID and an Element. The ID maps to the IDs in
            <code>#errors</code>. They're used to add detail and help message to
            the error output.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ID defaults to <code>0</code> which is an unclassified error
            type. The message for that ID includes a note to the developer to
            use an ID to classify the error. I consider it a bug if an
            appropriate ID doesn't exist and request an issue be open to fix it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <code>this.error()</code> method dumps the
            <code>bitty-js</code> elemnet after the message.
          </p>
          <p>
            If an element was passed to <code>this.error()</code> it's dumped
            out as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            The error message end up being pretty long. The end up adding a
            bunch of lines to the source file. That's an explicit decision aimed
            at making bitty easier to work with.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Added top level <code>debug</code> function that uses a
            <code>debug</code> search query param from the
            <code>window.location</code> to see if it should output.
          </p>
          <p>
            Only thing I don't like about it is that it shows the function's
            line number instead of the line number from where it was called.
            Something to look into.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          The <code>debug</code> function takes an optional element. It dumps it
          to the console if one comes in.
        </li>
        <li>
          Renamed <code>data-wires</code> to <code>data-bridge</code>. Fits
          better and maps nicer to the <code>.bridge</code> coming back in from
          the support class.
        </li>
        <li>
          Set up to load the default class exported from a widget module if no
          other class is defined (which happens with 'data-widget')
        </li>
        <li>
          Moved all examples to use a default class export instead of a named
          class
        </li>
        <li>
          Added a <code>data-widget</code> attribute to the
          <code>bitty-js</code> elements to allow using multiple classes from
          inside a single supporting .js module file.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>bitty-component-error</code> and
          <code>bitty-element-error</code> classes are added to the class list
          of elements where errors occur.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Version: 0.2.2</h3>
      <p>June 4, 2025</p>

      [! include "wrapper/do-not-edit-output-reminder.html" !]

      <p>
        Added UUIDs for pending error handling. Shuffeld a bunch of stuff around
        to make the examples look nicer.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Added uuids as <code>data-uuid</code> attrs to all elements with
            related <code>data-*</code> attributes. Added them to the
            <code>bitty-js</code> elements too. I was originally thinking I'd
            add the UUIDs on the elements internally (i.e.
            <code>el.uuid</code> instead of <code>el.dataset.uuid</code>).
          </p>
          <p>
            I decided on the attribute approach because it offers two benefits:
            1. You can see the IDs in the Element tree view of developer
            consoles, and 2. You can address them with CSS to update styles
            based on the UUID. Both of those thing will go to supporting better
            error messages and bug hunting.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Mostly content updates largely focused on detailing the opening
          counter example.
        </li>
        <li>Added CONTRIBUTING file.</li>
        <li>Added watcher script to build site when files change.</li>
        <li>
          Refined the initial counter example to remove the text and change the
          private variable to <code>this.num</code> to make the examples look
          nicer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Moved the Examples section directly below the initial basic
          functionality overview section.
        </li>
        <li>
          Added reminders all over the place to edit the template and instead of
          the output for HTML page (which would be overwritten. ask me how I
          know).
        </li>
        <li>
          Started adding <code>prettier-ignore</code> comments to code snippets
          to prevent the display output from being mangled.
        </li>
        <li>
          Started stripping <code>prettier-ignore</code> comments from the HTML
          output so it doesn't show in the example
        </li>
        <li>Same goes for <code>// deno-fmt-ignore-file</code> in .js files</li>
        <li>
          Added script to maintain the open open/closed states of the section
          details elements across page loads. (Having them close every time I
          made a change was maddening)
        </li>
        <li>
          Moved all the example <code>.js</code> files into the site root. Not a
          fan of that in general, but it makes the examples look better since
          the path is shorter.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Version: 0.2.1</h3>

      <p>June 3, 2025</p>

      [! include "wrapper/do-not-edit-output-reminder.html" !]

      <p>
        Some more wiring and some support tools for making the demo/docs site.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Made a Hello, World example that shows basic features. (Compared to
          the single button press from the prior first example.)
        </li>
        <li>Showing Hello, World code as part of the example.</li>
        <li>Load templates automatically.</li>
        <li>Throttling via <code>.requestAnimationFrame()</code>.</li>
        <li>
          Renamed <code>data-f</code> to <code>data-c</code> (i.e.
          &quot;call&quot;) for clarity.
        </li>
        <li>
          Renamed <code>data-prep</code> attribute on <code>bitty-js</code> tag
          to <code>data-call</code> (i.e. &quot;call&quot;) for clarity.
        </li>
        <li>
          Renamed <code>data-init</code> attribute on <code>bitty-js</code> tag
          to <code>data-send</code> so it matches <code>data-s</code> more
          closely.
        </li>
        <li>Made basic site builder for landing page.</li>
        <li>
          Moved everything into <code>details</code> elements for the landing
          page.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Version: 0.2.0</h3>
      <p>June 3, 2025</p>

      [! include "wrapper/do-not-edit-output-reminder.html" !]

      <p>Setting up a bunch of the basic wiring.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Rewrite to provide direct access to receiving elements. They are fully
          accessible in the send/receive functions. (As compared to the 0.1.0
          approach which required explicitly defining what would happen via an
          update (e.g. update <code>.innerHTML</code> or <code>.value</code>).
        </li>
        <li>
          Renamed <code>data-wrapper</code> and the target
          <code>Wrapper</code> class to <code>data-wires</code> and
          <code>Wires</code>. (<code>bitty.js</code> is the wrapper. The
          <code>Wires</code> class is how things are hooked up.).
        </li>
        <li>
          Added <code>data-call</code> attribute parsing to
          <code>bitty-js</code> tag. It runs functions like
          <code>data-c</code> but does so prior to adding the event listeners to
          the element.
        </li>
        <li>
          Added <code>data-batch</code> attribute processing to
          <code>bitty-js</code> tags. It operates like <code>data-b</code> but
          fires before event listeners are added.
        </li>
        <li>
          Added <code>data-ignore</code> attribute to allow components to avoid
          calls to the named functions. (Send signals bubble up to parents of
          nested components by default. This provides a way to ignore them).
        </li>
        <li>
          The <code>bitty-js</code> element looks for an
          <code>.init()</code> method in the <code>Wires</code> class. If it
          finds one it calls it during the initialization process.
        </li>
        <li>
          Passing both the element and the triggering event to the send/receive
          functions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Moved to using <code>data-b</code> explicitly to separate block calls
          from individual function calls.
        </li>
        <li>
          Order of operations is: function calls, batch calls, single send
          calls.
        </li>
        <li>
          Temporarily removed preflight check until global functionality is
          defined.
        </li>
        <li>
          Created example of loading a template via the
          <code>.init()</code> call back to the <code>Wires</code> class.
        </li>
        <li>Created example with nested components.</li>
        <li>
          Created example with parent of child components pulling data from the
          children to do a calculation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Created example showing parent ignoring send signals from children.
        </li>
        <li>
          Created example showing on components loading a child component via a
          template that becomes fully reactive.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Version: 0.1.0</h3>
      <p>June 2, 2025</p>

      [! include "wrapper/do-not-edit-output-reminder.html" !]

      <p>Getting the project started.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Initial prototype.</li>
        <li>
          <code>&ltbitty-js&gt;</code> wraps elements to provide them with
          reactive capabilities.
        </li>
        <li>
          Basic <code>data-c</code>, <code>data-s</code>, and
          <code>data-r</code>
          in place to call functions, send, and receive updates, respectively.
        </li>
        <li>
          Functionality is loaded using <code>data-wrapper</code> to point to a
          module to load. The module must export a <code>Wrapper</code> class
          that gets loaded and used to provide functions and send/receive
          callbacks.
        </li>
        <li>
          Uses string prefixes to make determinations about how to handle data
          through the send/receive channels (e.g.
          <code>htmlSOMETHING</code>
          updates <code>.innerHTML</code> of an element while
          <code>valueSOMETHING</code> updates the <code>.value</code>).
        </li>
        <li>
          Defined convention for functions. <code>data-c</code> maps to
          functions in the <code>Wrapper</code> class that start with a
          <code>_</code> (underscore). The <code>data-s</code> and
          <code>data-r</code> attributes map to functions in the
          <code>Wrapper</code> class that start with a <code>$</code> (dollar
          sign).
        </li>
        <li>
          Decided against using <code>data-c data-s and data-r</code> on the
          <code>bitty.js</code> tags. That would involved a lot of extra
          overhead in parsing to differentiate between the top level element and
          the content it wraps. Using <code>data-send</code> instead as a
          replacement for <code>data-c</code>. Others, TBD.
        </li>
        <li>
          Set up <code>data-c="batchSOMETHIGN"</code> functionality to send a
          single single that gets turned into multiple signals in the
          <code>Wrapper</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Defined convention of using <code>.batches</code> to look for batches.
          It must be a hash where the keys match the incoming request and the
          value is an array of functions to run.
        </li>
        <li>
          Defined <code>.bridge</code> to allow <code>Wrapper</code> functions
          to access the parent <code>bitty-js</code> element.
        </li>
        <li>Scoped event listeners to the <code>bitty-js</code> elements.</li>
        <li>
          Set up <code>data-listeners</code> attribute on
          <code>bitty-js</code> tags to override the default listeners (which
          are <code>input</code> and <code>click</code>).
        </li>
        <li>Created example that stores its own state.</li>
        <li>
          Created example that updates an element with the same content it sent
          (i.e. verified feedback can be avoided).
        </li>
        <li>
          Created example using <code>data-send</code> to load initial values.
        </li>
        <li>Created example that sends multiple signals.</li>
        <li>
          Created example with multiple elements receiving the same signal.
        </li>
        <li>
          Created example showing how to update global CSS variables/properties.
        </li>
        <li>Created example showing custom event listeners.</li>
        <li>
          Created example showing how to update CSS variables/properties scoped
          to the content of individual <code>bitty-js</code> tags.
        </li>
        <li>
          Examples use parent page's CSS for styling. It confirms I'm happy with
          the choice to use the light DOM instead of the shadow DOM.
        </li>
        <li>
          Set up initial preflight check to ensure functions are in place.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
