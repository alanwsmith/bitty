The entire __bitty-js API__ consists of six __data-*__ attributes
that are added to the HTML. 

- data-listeners
- data-module
- data-receive
- data-send
- data-use
- data-watch

Most of the time, you'll only use three:

- data-module
- data-send
- data-receive

##### data-module

The __data-module__ attribute is used directly on 
__&lt;bitty-js&gt;__ elements. Its value defines
the path to the JavaScript module responsible
for providing functionality to the element. 

For example:
