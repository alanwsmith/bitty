  <pre>


- TODO: Add documentation note about `event` being pulled from `window.event`
if nothing overrides it in scope. (e.g. if you bury an incoming
event with `_event` the `event` variable will still be populated
but might now have what you expect in it. 


- TODO: Document the `this.api` for calling back into the `bitty-js`
element and functionality from the module.

- Document `bittyInit()`

- Document that a uuid is added to each event
