- Signals can be sent from the bitty wrapper
when it initializes using a `data-send` attribute
directly on the element.

- Note that using `data-send` directly on the
bitty element does not currently send an event. 
This behaviour may change in the future. 

    See the "Initialize Values" section below
    for an example of checking to see if the
    event exists.
