- This is the counter to the prior example. 
It's here to demonstrate what happens when
`data-send` is used instead of `data-call`
and there are multiple elements registred
for the signal with `data-receive`. 
 
    Specifically, the number is incremented 
    for each element that recives the signal.
    
    (This isn't a problem if there's only 
    one element set to receive the signal
    with `data-receive` as you'll see
    in several of these examples.)
