This works but adds some overhead to 
the code. I think the play is to use
the code that assumes it's the only 
version on the page for the main
examples. Can add some documentation
about this check as well, but 
it would be secondary. 

Using the simpler code makes things
less robust, but I think the tradeoff
is worth it given that the main
target for this is folks who have
enough control over the page that
they'll be able to prevent 
multiple window.BittyClasses 
calls.
