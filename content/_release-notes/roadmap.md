## Roadmap 

- TODO: Investigate: Added a `disconnectedCallback()`
to clean up anything that can be
removed when a component is removed.

- TODO: Set up the `bitty` tag to listen
for signals with `data-receive` to allow
for things like completely switching out
the contents of the component without
having to rely on a child element calling
`.parentNode`.
