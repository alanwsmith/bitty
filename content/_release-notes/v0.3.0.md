### Version: 0.3.0

Sept. 16, 2025

Big refactor based on experience using 0.2.0.

- Added more generic error handing where you just send
a message and it outputs to the page along with the
UUID of the element that had the problem. The 
elements have `bitty-js-error` style classes on them
so their display can be controlled via CSS. 

- Updated to use the name `data-connect` instead of `data-module`

- The `data-connect` can point to either a module or
to a class in a global `bittyClasses` window object.

- Alternate module classes are selected by passing a `|` followed
by the desired class name instead of using `data-use`. 
(e.g. `data-connect="./module.js|AltClass`)

- If there's an `bittyInit()` function in a module it's the
first thing that gets called once bitty is loaded. 

- Removed `data-call`. The `data-send` attribute is used
for everything. Nothing would fire from it in prior versions
if there wasn't at least one element with a `data-receive` 
with the same name. Now it calls the function once
with no element if there's no associated `data-receive`

- Added test suite.

- The biggest update is changing `data-b`, `data-c`,
      `data-r`, and `data-s` to `data-batch`, 
      `data-call`, `data-receive`, and `data-send`,
      respectively. I originally use the shorter names to reduce the text
      length. The increased clarity of the longer names is worth the
      few extra characters.

- Remove expanded error messages. They were nice, but added a bunch of size
without a significant improvement. 

- The other big change is removing the leading `_` and
      `$` characters from function names. They were originally 
      put in place to create a naming convention that differentiated
      between functions that were hit with `data-call`
      and `data-send`. In practice, that wasn't necessary.

- Removed the `data-batch` attribute. While there are some use 
      cases where it might be nice, the extra complexity, mental overhead, and maintance 
      aren't worth it.

- Added Mutation Observer so data-* functionality works
      on elements that are added after initialization.

- Added Mutation Observer to watch for
      removed elements to pull them out of the mix when
      they get gone.

- Split the web site page up into individual template for sections. Much
      nicer to work with.

- Updated example functions to always use `(el, _event)` instead
      of `(el, _)` for clarity. 

- Removed inert/include/ignore from the top level
      components then remove them. This was originally a way to tell 
      parent components to ignore specific calls and signals from children. 
      After using it a bit, I don't think the complexity is worth it. 
      Better to just name functions an signals so they don't collide.

- Isolated default signal travel to only go down the DOM. 
  That is, if there are nested bitty-js tags, signals from 
  the child tags don't propagate to the parent by default. 
  (see `data-watch` for how to send signals up and to
  siblings)

- Added `data-watch` so parents and siblings
      can receive signals from their children and other
      siblings. With this, signals can be sent up, down, and
      to siblings.

- Ignore events directly from `bitty-js`
      elements (i.e. only process events from child elements).
      This is done to prevent `data-send` attributes on 
      `bitty-js` elements from firing repeatedly
      when things inside the element send events (e.g. clicks).

- Renamed `scripts` directory to `modules`.

- Moved bitty source script file under `bitty-versions/bitty-v0.3.0.js`
      and copying to prod at the root of the site (i.e. `/bitty-v0.3.0.js`)
      so examples look cleaner. 

- Renamed `data-bridge` to `data-connect` for clarity.

- Renamed `this.widget.bridge` to `this.module.api` in `bitty-js`

- Added `this.api.send(key, event)` to send/forward 
events from inside modules. 

- Added Progressive Enhancement and JavaScript Data comparison examples.

- Added/polished a bunch of other examples.
