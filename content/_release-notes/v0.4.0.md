### Version: 0.4.0

DATE: TBD

- TODO: Add minified versions and link to
them by default

- Flipped module arguments from `example(el, event)`
to `example(event, el)` since that lines up better
with the order of send/receive. (i.e. the `event`
is what gets sent from `data-send` and the `el`
is the element from `data-receive`

- TODO: Added test to confirm UUIDs are added to 
every element inside a bitty-js tag

- TODO: Added async tests and examples

- TODO: Add JavaScript Data Example

- TODO: Add example showing parent isolation

- TODO: Add tests for multiple instances
on a page

- Remove HTML output of error message. They're
nice during debug but wouldn't want them 
showing up in prod. Could use a `debug` flag
but that's more overhead than I want to add. 
So, message just go to the console.
