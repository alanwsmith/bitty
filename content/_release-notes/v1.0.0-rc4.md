### Version: 1.0.0-rc4

DATE: TBD

- Call `bittyInit()` with `await`
if it's an `async` function. 

- Added tests for `this.api.querySelector()`
and `document.querySelector()`

- Update site to use variables for version
numbers to make them easier to maintain
instead of having them in multiple places
for different displays.
