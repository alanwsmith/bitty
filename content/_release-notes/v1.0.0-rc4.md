### Version: 1.0.0-rc4

DATE: TBD

- Call `bittyInit()` with `await`
if it's an `async` function. 

- TODO: Allowing `this.api.forward()` to be called
with a `null` event (e.g. 
`this.api.forward(null, "anotherFunction");`). 
This is done to allow things like forwarding
a signal from `bittyInit()` or any other
function where there isn't an event to pass
along.

- Added tests for `this.api.querySelector()`
and `document.querySelector()`

- Update site to use variables for version
numbers to make them easier to maintain
instead of having them in multiple places
for different displays.
