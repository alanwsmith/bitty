### Version: 2.0.0-rc1

DATE: TBD

- Renamed `this.api.fetchJson()` to 
`this.api.fetchJSON()` to match case used
with `JSON.stringify()`, etc...

- Added substitutions param to 
`this.api.fetchJSON(url, subs=[])` so
all `.fetchTHING(url, subs=[])` methods
have the same behavior. 

- Added `this.api.fetchHTML(url, subs=[])`
that loads an HTML file and does find
replace with `subs` on the initial string 
where `subs` is an array
of arrays with the patterns to match and
replace. The patterns can be strings or regex. 

- Switched to array or arrays for find
replace strings for `this.api.useTemplate(templateString, subs=[])`
and defaulting to an empty array so the
argument doesn't have be sent which
is consistent with the `.fetchTHING(url, subs=[])`

- Added `this.api.fetchSVG(url, subs=[])`
that loads an SVG file and does find
replace with `subs` which is an array
of arrays with the patterns to match and
replace. The patterns can be strings or regex. 

- Added `this.api.loadCSS(url, subs=[])`
that loads an CSS file and does find
replace with `subs` which is an array
of arrays with the patterns to match and
replace. The patterns can be strings or regex. 
The CSS is added to the document as an adopted
stylesheet. Returns the stylesheet element
if it was successful. Otherwise returns undefined. 

- Added an adoptedStylesheet that sets
the `<bitty-x-x>` tag to `display: block`. 

- TODO: Added top level function `matchData(event, el, KEY)`
that  checks `event.target.dataset.KEY` against
`el.dataset.KEY` and returns `true` if
they match or `false` if the don't (or
if one or both is missing)

- TODO: Added top level function `matchUUID(event, el)` 
that checks `event.target.dataset.uuid` against
`el.dataset.uuid` and returns `true` if
they match or `false` if the don't (or
if one or both is missing)
