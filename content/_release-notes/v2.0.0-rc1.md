### Version: 2.0.0-rc1

DATE: TBD

- Renamed `this.api.fetchJson()` to 
`this.api.fetchJSON()` to match case used
with `JSON.stringify()`, etc...

- Added substitutions param to 
`this.api.fetchJSON(url, subs=[])` so
all `.fetchTHING(url, subs=[])` methods
have the same behavior. 

- Added `this.api.fetchHTML(url, subs=[])`
that loads an HTML file and does find
replace with `subs` on the initial string 
where `subs` is an array
of arrays with the patterns to match and
replace. The patterns can be strings or regex. 

- Switched to array or arrays for find
replace strings for `this.api.useTemplate(templateString, subs=[])`
and defaulting to an empty array so the
argument doesn't have be sent which
is consistent with the `.fetchTHING(url, subs=[])`

- Added `this.api.fetchSVG(url, replacments)`
that loads an SVG file and does find
replace with `replacments` which is an array
of arrays with the patterns to match and
replace. The patterns can be strings or regex. 

- TODO: Added `this.api.fetchCSS(url, replacments)`
that loads an SVG file and does find
replace with `replacments` which is an array
of arrays with the patterns to match and
replace. The patterns can be strings or regex. 


- TODO: Added top level function `matchData(event, el, KEY)`
that  checks `event.target.dataset.KEY` against
`el.dataset.KEY` and returns `true` if
they match or `false` if the don't (or
if one or both is missing)

- TODO: Added top level function `matchUUID(event, el)` 
that checks `event.target.dataset.uuid` against
`el.dataset.uuid` and returns `true` if
they match or `false` if the don't (or
if one or both is missing)




- TODO: Set up a way to allow for awaiting
forwarded signals. 


- TODO: Set `display: block` if there is
no `class` or `style` on the `bitty` tag. 
(TBD if it should be `block` or `inline-block`
after digging into the details)
