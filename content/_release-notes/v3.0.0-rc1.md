### Version: 3.0.0-rc1

DATE: TBD

- TODO: Did the following renames and
additions to make a consistenly 
names API for getting/adding
elements/documet fragments.

    - TODO: Renamed `this.api.getHTML()` to
    `this.api.getFragment()` 

    - TODO: Added `this.api.getElement()`
    which returns a single element
    instead of a document fragment

    - TODO: Renamed `this.api.useTemplate()`
    to `this.api.makeFragment()`

    - TODO: Added `this.api.makeElement()`

- Added `connectedMoveCallback()` to 
prevent `connectedCallback()` from firing
if a component is moved


- Moved everything in the init
into the conditional check to see if 
the component makes a connection to a class. 
Previous a few things happend prior to 
the connection attempt. Moving them in
prevents UUIDs from being added until
a conneciton has been made. 


- TODO: When returning values from fetches
return an object with either `{ ok: PAYLOAD }`, 
or `{ error: { text: ERROR_TEXT } }` with 
extra data coming down in the error object
like status codes for HTML errors. 

- TODO: Added custom BittyError class
for better error handling with `this.api.getTHING`
calls that use `.fetch`
