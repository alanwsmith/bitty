### Version: 4.0.0

TBD

- Renamed `this.api.getFragment` to 
`this.api.getElements` (this is a breaking
change so it's a major version bump)

- Renamed `this.api.makeFragment` to 
`this.api.makeElements` (with the 
`this.api.getFragment` change)

- TODO: Added `bittyCatch(event)` that
catches any events that don't have a
`.target.dataset.send` value. This provides
a way to catch message like from `.postMessage()`
and decided what to do with them. 

- Changed internal use of 
`event.target.dataset.forward` key for
`this.api.forward` to `event.bitty.forward`
to avoid collisions on the `event.target.dataset`

- Fixed bug in `this.api.forward` where
an event that doesn't have a `.target` or
`.target.dataset` gets overridded. 

- UUID are added to events that are being
forwareded if they don't already exist. 

- Migrated docs site to use variables
to make it easier to upgrade versions
moving forward.
