# Version 5.0.0-rc1

DATE: TBD

This is a collection of renames for clarity
and to help avoid collisions with 
other code that migth add `data-` attributes. 
No actual funciontality is changed, but
the renames require a version number
bump.

- Renamed `getElements` to `getHTML` for
clarity. (`getElement` remains the same
and pulls individual HTML elements
vs `getHTML` which pulls document fragments.)

- Renamed `makeElements` to `makeHTML` for
clarity. (`makeElement` remains the same
and makes individual HTML elements
vs `makeHTML` which makes document fragments.)

- Renamed `response.ok` to `response.value`
for clarity and to avoid confusion with
things like `response.ok === false`. 
(i.e. `response.value === false` takes less 
mental overhead)

- TODO: Renamed `data-uuid` to `data-bittyid`
to namespace and prevent collisions with
anything else the wants to use `data-uuid`
