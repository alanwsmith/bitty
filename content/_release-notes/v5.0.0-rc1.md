# Version 5.0.0-rc1

DATE: TBD

- TODO: Renamed `getElements` and `makeElements`
to `getHTML` and `makeHTML`. They are for 
working with document fragments. (`getElement` and
`makeElement` stay the same and continue
to work with individual HTML elements.)

- TODO: Renamed `response.ok` to `response.value`
for clarity and to avoid confusion with
things like `response.ok === false`. 
(i.e. `response.value === false` takes less 
mental overhead)

- TODO: Renamed `data-uuid` to `data-bittyid`
to namespace and prevent collisions with
anything else the wants to use `data-uuid`
