Version: 5.1.0-rc3

DATE TBD

- TODO: Added `data-init` for elements that
fires a signal that they receive 
when bitty first initializes. 

- TODO: Added the ability to do find and
replace where the replace value is 
either an HTML Element or Document 
Fragment (as opposed to just 
a string)

- TODO: Added the ability to pass
and array of element as substitutions
for `getHTML()`, `getElement()`, 
`makeHTML()`, and `makeElement()`.

- TODO: Only add data-bittyid to elements
that have a data-send or data-receive?

- TODO: Removed `data-s` and `data-r` from
`-rc2`. I'd rather things be explicit and
only have a single way to do it. 

- TODO: Stopped adding `bittyid` with UUID from 
events.
