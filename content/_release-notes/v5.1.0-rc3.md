- Added `data-init` for elements that
fires a signal that they receive 
when bitty first initializes. 

- Only add `data-bittyid` to elements
that have a `data-send`, `data-receive`,
`data-init` attributes. 

- Stopped adding `bittyid` with UUID from 
events. 

- Removed `data-r` alias for `data-receive`. 
Better to have things be explicit and
only have a single way to do it. (`data-s`
was removed in `-rc2`)
