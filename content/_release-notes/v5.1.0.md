Version: 5.1.0

DATE TBD

- Added `bittyReady()` call that
works like `bittyInit()` but happens
after `this.runSendFromComponent();`

- If `bittyReady()` is defined
as async (i.e. `async bittyReady()`) it's
called with `await`

- Added `this.api.trigger(signal)` which
works like `this.api.forward(null, signal)`.
The event type is `bittytrigger`

- With `this.api.trigger(signal)` using 
`this.api.forward(event, signal)` with 
`event` set to `null` is now an error. 
It's explicitly for forwarding an
existing event. 

- TODO: Added `await:signal` to `data-send`
and `this.api.forward(event, "await:signal")`,
and `this.api.trigger("await:signal")`
to await async methods.
