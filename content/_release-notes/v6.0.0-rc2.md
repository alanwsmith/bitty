### Version: 6.0.0-rc2

Nov. 25, 2025

- Updated the `data-connect` process
so that URLs that start with a `/`
get updated with the origin of the
`window.location.href` to avoid issues
when using CDNs for the `bitty-#.#.#...` 
file. 

  At this time, relative URLs that start
  with a `.` are not yet supported.
