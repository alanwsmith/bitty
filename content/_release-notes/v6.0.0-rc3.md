### Version: 6.0.0-rc3

DATE TBD

- TODO: Added `event.target.stringValue` the
returns the `event.target.value` as a string. 
(this is effectively an alias that's only here
to keep the mental model with `.intValue` and
`.floatValue` consistent)

- TODO: Added `event.target.intValue` the
returns the `event.target.value` as an
integer. 

- TODO: Added `event.target.intFloat` the
returns the `event.target.value` as an
float. 

- TODO: Added `event.target.getString()`

- TODO: Added `event.target.getInt()`

- TODO: Added `event.target.getFloat()`

- TODO: Added `event.sender.getString()`

- TODO: Added `event.sender.getInt()`

- TODO: Added `event.sender.getFloat()`

- TODO: Consider: `el.matchString(KEY)` which 
would traverse up the DOM look looking for
a key from the `el` and match first against
the same value that would be returned from
`event.target.getString(KEY)` and then 
`event.sender.getString(KEY)`

- TODO: Consider `el.matchTargetString/Int/Float(KEY)`
and `el.matchSenderString/Int/Float(KEY)`
that would work like `el.matchString/Int/Float(KEY)`
but would look at `event.target` and `event.sender`
separately. 

- TODO: Remove setting `style="display: block;"`.
Leaving this as a decision at implementation time.
