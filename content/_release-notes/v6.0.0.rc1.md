### Version 6.0.0-rc1

- Added `this.api.getBittyParent(el)` that
returns the bitty element that contains
the `el` element. If the `el` element
is a bitty tag it returns itself. 

- Added `data-bittyid` attrs to 
everything so they can be used for 
comparisons. 

- Events are captured from every
element (not just those with `data-send` and
`data-receive`). Events bubble up
the document where bitty looks for
them on the window object. 

- TODO: For the bitty events, include the 
target that the event happened on and then
the `sender` that is the element that
had the `data-send` on it. (e.g. if 
a child element is clicked, it's the
target and then bubbles up to the closest
`data-send` attr which becomes the sender)

- TODO: Added `el.bittyParent` that 
contains a reference to the bitty parent 
element

- TODO: Added `el.bittyParentId` that 
contains a reference to the bitty parent 
element's data-bittyid

- Removed `this.api.match()` in
favor of `el.isTarget` and `el.isSender`.
(`this.api.matchTarget()` and `this.api.matchSender()`
existed briefly but were also removed
as part of the transition to `el.isTarget`
and `el.isSender`.

- Added `el.isTarget()` which is boolean
that indicates if the element is 
the one that generated the event. 

- Added `el.isSender()` which is boolean
that indicates if the element is 
the one with `data-send` that sent
the event (which may or may not
be the same as the target identified
by `el.isTarget()`

- TODO: Set up so events bubble up for 
everything (e.g. to ensure that clicking on 
child elements triggers the `data-send` for
the parent element)

- TODO: NOTE: Review all `bitty...` event names
and line things up consistently. 

- TODO: Renamed `data-send` to `data-init` on the
`<bitty-#-#>` tags to match `data-init`
behavior on child elements (i.e. only fires
once when the elemnt is initialized)

- TODO: Confirm you can click on a bitty 
tag with `data-send` and it sends the event. 

- Converted `bitty...` pseudo-events to 
classes extended from `Event`. All events
are set to bubble up the document. 

- Created `this.api.localTrigger(SIGNAL_STRING)` 
that only sends the signal to the local element
without bubbling and without descending into
child bitty elements. 

- Added `el.getString(KEY)` which 
goes up the DOM looking for a matching
`dataset.KEY` that's a String.

- Added `el.getInt(KEY)` which 
goes up the DOM looking for a matching
`dataset.KEY` that's an Int.

- Added `el.getFloat(KEY)` which 
goes up the DOM looking for a matching
`dataset.KEY` that's a Float.

- Remove `bittyCatch()` functionality. 
It's not necessary now that all events 
are examined by this listener without 
extra filtering. 

- Removed adopted stylesheet to set
`[@ tag_name @]` to block. This saves
loading duplicate stylesheets for each 
[@ tag_name @] instance.

- Using `thie.style.display` to set [@ tag_name @]
element to block. That way it can be changed
easier by editing the style directly (e.g.
by updated the style in the `bittyInit` 
function)

- TODO: Added `el.remove()` to remove the
node from the DOM.

- Cleaned up tests
