### Version 6.0.0-rc1

- Added `this.api.getBittyParent(el)` that
returns the bitty element that contains
the `el` element. If the `el` element
is a bitty tag it returns itself. 

- Added `data-bittyid` attrs to 
everything so they can be used for 
comparisons. 

- Events are captured from every
element (not just those with `data-send` and
`data-receive`). Events bubble up
the document where bitty looks for
them on the window object. 

- TODO: For the bitty events, include the 
target that the event happened on and then
the `sender` that is the element that
had the `data-send` on it. (e.g. if 
a child element is clicked, it's the
target and then bubbles up to the closest
`data-send` attr which becomes the sender)

- Split `this.api.match()`, to
`this.api.matchTarget()` and `this.api.matchSender()`
so you can match the two different 
elements coming in from the event
(i.e. `event.target` and `event.sender`)

- TODO: Set up so events bubble up for 
everything (e.g. to ensure that clicking on 
child elements triggers the `data-send` for
the parent element)

- TODO: NOTE: Review all `bitty...` event names
and line things up consistently. 

- TODO: Renamed `data-send` to `data-init` on the
`<bitty-#-#>` tags to match `data-init`
behavior on child elements (i.e. only fires
once when the elemnt is initialized)

- TODO: Confirm you can click on a bitty 
tag with `data-send` and it sends the event. 

- Converted `bitty...` pseudo-events to 
classes extended from `Event`. All events
are set to bubble up the document. 

- TODO: Created `this.api.localTrigger(SIGNAL)` 
that only sends the signal to the local element
without bubbling (maybe: or descending to build
bitty-#-# elements)

TODO: Determine if the localTrigger should
go down to child elements. Maybe there
needs to be triggerDown to go
down the tree (along with the current
element)

- TODO: Added `this.api.getString(KEY)` which 
goes up the DOM looking for a matching
`dataset.KEY` that's a String.

- TODO: Added `this.api.getInt(KEY)` which 
goes up the DOM looking for a matching
`dataset.KEY` that's an Int.

- TODO: Added `this.api.getFloat(KEY)` which 
goes up the DOM looking for a matching
`dataset.KEY` that's a Float.

- TODO: VERIFY: `this.api.trigger()` can 
make multiple calls (e.g. `this.api.trigger("alfa bravo")`)

- Remove bittyCatch. It's not necessary
now that all events are examined by
this listener without extra filtering. 

- Cleaned up tests
