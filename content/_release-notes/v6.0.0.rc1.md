### Version 6.0.0-rc1

- TODO: Review all `bitty...` event names
and line things up consistently. 

- TODO: Renamed `data-send` to `data-init` on the
`<bitty-#-#>` tags to match `data-init`
behavior on child elements. 

- TODO: Renamed `bittytagdatasend` pseudoevent to
`bittyselfinit`.



- TODO: Created `this.api.triggerLocal(SIGNAL)` 
that only sends the signal to the local element
without bubbling or descending to build
bitty-#-# elements

TODO: Determine if the triggerLocal should
go down to child elements. Maybe there
needs to be triggerDown to go
down the tree (along with the current
element)

- TODO: Added `el.getData(KEY)` which 
goes up the DOM looking for a matching
`dataset.KEY`

- TODO: Added `el.getDataInt(KEY)` which 
goes up the DOM looking for a matching
`dataset.KEY` that's an INT

- TODO: Added `el.getDataFloat(KEY)` which 
goes up the DOM looking for a matching
`dataset.KEY` that's a Float.



- TODO: Cleaned up tests
