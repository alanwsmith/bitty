### Version 6.0.0-rc1

- TODO: NOTE: Review all `bitty...` event names
and line things up consistently. 

- TODO: Renamed `data-send` to `data-init` on the
`<bitty-#-#>` tags to match `data-init`
behavior on child elements (i.e. only fires
once when the elemnt is initialized)

- TODO: Renamed `bittytagdatasend` pseudoevent to
`bittyselfinit`.

- TODO: Renamed `bittyOLDNAMEGOESHERE` to
`bittychildinit`

- TODO: Created `this.api.localTrigger(SIGNAL)` 
that only sends the signal to the local element
without bubbling or descending to build
bitty-#-# elements

TODO: Determine if the localTrigger should
go down to child elements. Maybe there
needs to be triggerDown to go
down the tree (along with the current
element)

- TODO: Renamed `this.api.match()` to
`this.api.matchString()`

  NOTE: See if you can do the 
matches without havint to send
the `event` and `el` in explicity
(e.g. can they be picked up
from the scope)

- TODO: Added `this.api.matchInt()`

- TODO: Added `this.api.matchFloat()`

- TODO: Added `this.api.getString(KEY)` which 
goes up the DOM looking for a matching
`dataset.KEY` that's a String.

- TODO: Added `this.api.getInt(KEY)` which 
goes up the DOM looking for a matching
`dataset.KEY` that's an Int.

- TODO: Added `this.api.getFloat(KEY)` which 
goes up the DOM looking for a matching
`dataset.KEY` that's a Float.

- TODO: Cleaned up tests

- TODO: VERIFY: `this.api.trigger()` can 
make multiple calls (e.g. `this.api.trigger("alfa bravo")`)
