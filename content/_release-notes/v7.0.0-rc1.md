### Version: 7.0.0-rc1

This update is a largely a set of API refinements to 
make things more obvious and consistent. It 
also adds `data-use` which allows an element
to send a signal that only it uses. 

- Added `data-use` which sends a signal 
from an element which is only processed by 
the element itself (e.g. if there are several
elements with the same `data-use` or `data-send`
values the other aren't processed). This
means you don't have to check `.isSender` or
`isTarget` if you don't need to update other
elements from a signal. (You'd still need
them for doing different things when
every element needs to be updated differently
depending on if it's the sender/target or not.)

- Moved `ev.sender` to `el.sender` The sender 
element is no longer appended
to the event. It's added to the element instead
so that all general usage can be done through
the element (e.g. `el`) argument.

- Moved `el.getString(KEY)` to `el.stringData(KEY)` 
- Moved `el.getInt(KEY)` to `el.intData(KEY)` 
- Moved `el.getFloat(KEY)` to `el.floatData(KEY)` 

- Added: `el.targetStringData(KEY)` - Removed `ev.target.getString(KEY)` 
- Added: `el.targetIntData(KEY)` - Removed `ev.target.getInt(KEY)`

- Removed `ev.target.getFloat(KEY)` 
- Added: `el.targetFloatData(KEY)`

- Removed `ev.target.stringValue(KEY)` 
- Added: `el.targetStringValue(KEY)`

- Removed `ev.target.intValue(KEY)` 
- Added: `el.targetIntValue(KEY)`

- Removed `ev.target.floatValue(KEY)` 
- Added: `el.targetFloatValue(KEY)`

- Removed `ev.sender.getString(KEY)`
- Added: `el.senderStringData(KEY)`

- Removed `ev.sender.getInt(KEY)` 
- Added: `el.senderIntData(KEY)`

- Removed `ev.sender.getFloat(KEY)`
- Added: `el.senderFloatData(KEY)`

- Removed `ev.sender.stringValue(KEY)` 
- Added: `el.senderStringValue(KEY)`

- Removed `ev.sender.intValue(KEY)` 
- Added: `el.senderIntValue(KEY)`

- Removed `ev.sender.floatValue(KEY)` 
- Added: `el.senderFloatValue(KEY)`

- Added `el.stringValue`
- Added `el.intValue`
- Added `el.floatValue`

- Added `el.targetBittyId`
- Added `el.senderBittyId`

- Renamed `el.bittyParentId` to `el.bittyParentBittyId` to be
consistent with other `...BittyId` properties. 

- Renamed `el.matchTarget(KEY)` to `el.matchTargetData(KEY)`
- Renamed `el.matchSender(KEY)` to `el.matchSenderData(KEY)`


- Added `ev.stringValue` 
these are for when a method is run without a receiver and 
the target is an input. 

- Added `ev.intValue`
these are for when a method is run without a receiver and 
the target is an input. 

- Added `ev.floatValue`
these are for when a method is run without a receiver and 
the target is an input. 

- Added `ev.stringData(KEY)` 
these are for when a method is run without a receiver and 
the target is an input. 

- Added `ev.intData(KEY)` 
these are for when a method is run without a receiver and 
the target is an input. 

- Added `ev.floatData(KEY)` 
these are for when a method is run without a receiver and 
the target is an input.
