### Version: 7.0.0-rc1

This update is a largely a set of API refinements to 
make things more obvious and consistent. It 
also adds `data-use` which allows an element
to send a signal that only it uses. 

- TODO: Added `this.api.makeSVG` which takes a
text string and turns it into an SVG. 

- TODO: Moved `bittyInit` back to inline instead
of running as an event to allow `async/await`.

- TODO: Moved `bittyReady` back to inline instead
of running as an event to allow `async/await`.

- Added `data-use` which sends a signal 
from an element which is only processed by 
the element itself (e.g. if there are several
elements with the same `data-use` or `data-send`
values the other aren't processed). This
means you don't have to check `.isSender` or
`isTarget` if you don't need to update other
elements from a signal. (You'd still need
them for doing different things when
every element needs to be updated differently
depending on if it's the sender/target or not.)

  The `data-use` attribute picks up events
  from child element the same way `data-send`
  does. 

- Moved `ev.sender` to `el.sender` The sender 
element is no longer appended
to the event. It's added to the element instead
so that all general usage can be done through
the element (e.g. `el`) argument.

- TODO: Moved `el.getString(KEY)` to `el.data(KEY)`

- Added `el.targetBittyId`
- Added `el.senderBittyId`

- Renamed `el.bittyParentId` to `el.bittyParentBittyId` to be
consistent with other `...BittyId` properties. 

- Renamed `el.matchTarget(KEY)` to `el.matchTargetData(KEY)`
- Renamed `el.matchSender(KEY)` to `el.matchSenderData(KEY)`


- TODO: Added `ev.value` 
these are for when a method is run without a receiver and 
the target is an input. 

- TODO: Added `ev.valueInt`
these are for when a method is run without a receiver and 
the target is an input. 

- TODO: Added `ev.valueFloat`
these are for when a method is run without a receiver and 
the target is an input. 

- TODO: Added `ev.data(KEY)` 
these are for when a method is run without a receiver and 
the target is an input. 

- TODO: Added `ev.dataInt(KEY)` 
these are for when a method is run without a receiver and 
the target is an input. 

- TODO: Added `ev.dataFloat(KEY)` 
these are for when a method is run without a receiver and 
the target is an input. 

- TODO: Added `el.data(KEY)` which is an alias to `el.dataset.key`
which gets returns as a string. 

- TODO: Added `el.senderData(KEY)` which is an alias to `el.sender.dataset.key`
which gets returns as a string. 

- TODO: Added `el.targetData(KEY)` which is an alias to `ev.sender.dataset.key`
which gets returns as a string.
