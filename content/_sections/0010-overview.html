**bitty-js** is a web component. It adds reactivity to web pages. 
For example:
[! endfilter !]

<div class="add-bitty-flow">
  [! include "_misc/_timestamp-demo.html" !]
</div>

[! filter markdown|safe !]
The **API**  uses __data-*__ attributes:
[! endfilter !]

<pre class="code-block large-block-margin">
  [@- highlight["_misc/_timestamp-demo.html"]|safe -@]
  [@- "\n" -@]
  [@- highlight["_includes/_script-tag.html"]|safe -@]
</pre>

- **data-connection** connects to the script responsible for functionality.
- **data-receive** registers the **div** to react to **update** signals.
- **data-send** tells the **button** to send **update** signals.

#### Functionality 

The values from the **data-send** and **data-receive**
attributes map to functions with the same name.
[! endfilter !]

<pre class="code-block large-block-margin">
  [@- highlight["modules/timestamp-demo.js"]|safe -@]
</pre>

- The **update** function handles signals from elements with **data-send="update"**
- Elements with **data-receive="update"** are processed by the **update** function.

The two arguments passed to a **bitty-js function** are:

1. The element to update
2. The event that triggered the update

The element is the same you'd get from __document.querySelector()__. 

The event is the same you'd get from __document.addListener()__.

The **div** element in the example has its **innerHTML** updated 
with the timestamp. The event isn't used in this case.
