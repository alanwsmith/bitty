**bitty-js** is a web component. It makes reactive web pages. 
For example:
[! endfilter !]

<div class="make-two-columns warning-border-faded default-radius xxlarge-inline-margin">
  [! include "_sections/_timestamp-demo.html" !]
</div>

[! filter markdown|safe !]
The **bitty-js API** uses __data-*__ attributes:
[! endfilter !]

<pre class="code-block large-block-margin"><code>
  [@- highlighted["_sections/_timestamp-demo.html"]|safe -@]
  [@- "\n\n" -@]
  [@- highlighted["_includes/_script-tag.html"]|safe -@]
</code></pre>

- **data-module** connects to the file responsible for functionality.
- **data-send** tells the **button** to send an **update** signal.
- **data-receive** registers the **div** to react to **update** signals.

#### Functionality 

**bitty-js** uses the values from **data-send** and **data-receive**
to map to functions with the same name.
[! endfilter !]

<pre class="code-block large-block-margin"><code>
  [@- highlighted["modules/timestamp-demo.js"]|safe -@]
</code></pre>

- The **update** function handles signals from elements with **data-send="update"**
- Elements with **data-receive="update"** are processed by the **update** function.

The two arguments passed to a **bitty-js function** are:

1. The element to update
2. The event that triggered the update

The event is ignored in the timestamp demo. The 
**div** element has its **innerHTML** updated 
with the timestamp.

#### As Simple As I Can Make It

The goal of **bitty-js** is to make
reactive pages with as little friction as possible. To wit,
**bitty-js** is:

- A single file web component
- Written in vanilla JavaScript
- Powered by standard HTML attributes
- Designed for both progressive enhancement and API based content loading
- Stylable via the light DOM


#### Feedback Requested

**bitty-js** is currently **beta version 0.3.0**. 
The API is stable. Aside from bug fixes, it will become **version 1.0**. 
Play around with it. Let me know if you find bugs or show-stoppers.

#### Happy Coding

I put a lot of thought and effort into **bitty-js**. All
of it aimed at making things simpler. I'm really proud of where it ended up.
I hope it helps you enjoy making things for the web.
