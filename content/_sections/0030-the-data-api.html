<summary>The data-* API</summary>

[! filter markdown|safe !]
**bitty-js** uses six __data-*__ attributes:

- **data-listeners** - Changes the event
listeners. (The 
defaults are **click** and **input**)

  _Can only be used in **bitty-js elements**._

- **data-module** - The path to the JavaScript
module responsible for providing functionality.

  _Can only be used in **bitty-js elements**._

- **data-receive** - Sets up child elements
to receive signals. The value is the name of
the funciton that's used for the signal.

  _Only used in **child elements**._

- **data-send** - Defines signals for the
element to send. The value is the name of
the funciton that's used for the signal.

  Signals are sent from the **bitty-js** element 
when the component is initialized. They are sent
from child elements when one of their event listeners
fires. 

  _Available in both **bitty-js elements** and **child elements**._

- **data-use** - for using alternaive
classes exported from the modules.

  _Can only be used in **bitty-js elements**._

- **data-watch** - Watching for signals coming
from below the element so signals can be set up
the DOM tree as well as down.

  _Only used in **child elements**._
