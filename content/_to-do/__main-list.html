- Show error if the connection doesn't
  work if the file is missing. (might
  already be happening, just
  need to confirm)

- TODO: figure out if it makes sense
  to allow `data-receive` on the
  bitty component element itself
  so you can do useTemplate
  by doing a `data-send` to itself.

  Also, figure out if other 
  bitty elements can send
  to each other through data-send
  and data-receive
