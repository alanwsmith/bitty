[#
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>data-init</code> is designed to do the initial 
    load in of elements on a page.
  </li>
  <li>Signals defined by the <code>data-init</code> attribute fire once
    when the component is initalizing.</li>
  <li>The signals are processed after <code>bittyInit()</code> is
    called in the class and before <code>data-send</code> signals
    from the 
    [@ highlight_code("<" + bitty_tag + ">", "html")|safe  @]
    tag are sent.
  </li>
  <li>
    Child elements with `data-init` attributes that
    are added to a bitty element after it has
    been initialized _do not_ fire the `data-init` 
    process. 
  </li>

</ul>
