<p>async signals can be awaited by prefacing them with 
  <code>await:</code> (i.e. <code>await:someSignal someOtherSignal</code>)</p>

<p>TODO: add await example</p>
<p>NOTE: Each bitty element on a page receives signlas independently. 
There is no built-in await across them if more than
one receive the signal</p>
