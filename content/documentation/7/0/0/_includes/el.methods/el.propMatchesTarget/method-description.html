- The 
[! filter inline_highlight("js") !]el.propMatchesTarget(KEY)[! endfilter !]
method returns a
[! filter inline_highlight("js") !]boolean[! endfilter !] 
that is determined by comparing the
[! filter inline_highlight("html") !]data-KEY="VALUE"[! endfilter !] 
for the 
[! filter inline_highlight("js") !]el[! endfilter !] 
and its ancestor tree with that of the 
[! filter inline_highlight("html") !]data-KEY="VALUE"[! endfilter !] 
from 
[! filter inline_highlight("js") !]ev.target[! endfilter !] 
and its ancestor tree.
