<h2>Script Inclusion</h2>

<p>
  All the examples on the page are live. The code you
  see on the page is what's running behind the scenes. 
  You can copy and past the code blocks on your own
  site and they'll run there as well. The only 
  changes you need to make are:
</p>
<ol>
  <li><p>Load the bitty web component once on the page
    with the script tag:</p>
    [! filter block_highlight("html") !]
    [@ bitty_script_tag @]
    [! endfilter !]</li>
  <li>
    Wrap the <strong>JavaScript</strong> example blocks in 
    a [! filter inline_highlight("html") !]<script></script>[! endfilter !]
    tag. 
  </li>

    
</ol>
