            <strong>Head's up:</strong> 
            This page is still a 
            work-in-progress.
            The code is stable but there's a few
            tweaks pending. The syntax highlighting 
            colors also need work and there's 
            more documentation to add before things 
            are ready for a full release. 
          </p>
          <p>
            You can get an idea of how things
            work from the examples. They're
            all live. The code for each
            is underneath it.
