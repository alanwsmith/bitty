<h2>Example</h2>

<p>
Here's the HTML snippet that's used in the example:
</p> 

[!- filter block_highlight("html") -!]
[!- include file.folder + "/_content.html" -!]
[!- endfilter -!]

<p>And here's what the output
looks like after bitty makes
the updates:</p>

<div class="example-block">
[!- include file.folder + "/_content.html" -!]
</div>

<p>
NOTE: syntax highlighting and line
numbers come from my site generator
and corresponding CSS. They are
off in the example output 
to demonstrate just the updates
the <strong>bit</strong> makes.
