## Overview

- This <strong>bit</strong><sup><a id="fn-1-body" href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> 
updates code blocks. It
add buttons to copy the code, change
the font size, and toggle wrapping. 

- The updates are done via progressive 
enhancement (i.e. the element renders
as it normally would without the
enhancements if JavaScript is
unavailable or fails).
