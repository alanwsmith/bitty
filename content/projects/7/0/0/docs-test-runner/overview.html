[! filter markdown|safe !]
## Overview

- This <strong>bit</strong> is the test runner that
checks the documentation for the site.

- It scans the page looking for elements with a 
[! filter inline_highlight("html") !]data-expects[! endfilter !]
attribute. The values of those attributes
are compared with the 
[! filter inline_highlight("js") !].innerHTML[! endfilter !]
. If the values match, the tests passes. Otherwise,
it fails.

- A pass/fail status element is added to the
individual test and it's parent method/property
with the result. 

- This doesn't use a lot of bitty's functionality
beyond the initial trigger. Everything else
is query selector stuff. That's done to
prevent conflicts with the `data-*`
attributes that the test inputs need
to send and receive.
