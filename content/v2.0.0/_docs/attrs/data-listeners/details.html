<p>The data-listeners attribute changes the events a component listens
for. The default events are `click` and `input`. Changing it to listen
to `mouseenter` looks like this:</p>

[! include config.version_dir + "/_docs/attrs/data-listeners/mouseover/content.html" !]


<p>Multiple listeners can be added by separating them
with a pipe (<code>|</code>) character:</p>

[! include config.version_dir + "/_docs/attrs/data-listeners/mouseover-out/content.html" !]

<p>Using `data-listeners` remove the default `click` and `input`
listeners. They can be added back in explicitly if needed.</p>
