<summary class="docs-summary">UUIDs for Elements</summary>

<p>Every bitty component and all their child elements
automatically receive a `data-uuid` attribute with a UUID.
They can be used any time an ID is needed. They 
are also the default values that are compared
via `this.api.match(event, el)` if no other key
is provided.
