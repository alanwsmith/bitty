<h4>Basic Signal Forwarding</h4>

<p>Forwarding an event from one signal to another looks like this:</p>

[! include config.version_dir + "/_docs/members/forward/examples/basic/content.html" !]

<h4>null Event Forwarding</h4>

<p>The `event` can be `null`. For example, if
an initial update is made that branches
into a conditional update where the event
isn't required it doesn't have to be
sent.</p>


[! include config.version_dir + "/_docs/members/forward/examples/null/content.html" !]
