<p>Forwarding an event from one signal to another looks like this:</p>
[! include config.version_dir + "/_docs/members/forward/examples/basic/content.html" !]
</details>

<details><summary>null Event Forwarding</summary>
<p>The `event` can be `null`. For example, if
an initial update is made that branches
into a conditional update where the event
isn't required it doesn't have to be
sent.</p>
[! include config.version_dir + "/_docs/members/forward/examples/null/content.html" !]
