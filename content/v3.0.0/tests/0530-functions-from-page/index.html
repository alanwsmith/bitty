  NOTE: This test also partially covers getting functions
  from the <code>const functions = {}</code> variable
  in the module file itself. That variable is designed
  to provide plug in functionality from other functions. 
  There's nothing in the default version of bitty
  so there's nothing to test directly. But, it's
  in the same loop as this test. As long as this
  passes then confidence in the other is high.
