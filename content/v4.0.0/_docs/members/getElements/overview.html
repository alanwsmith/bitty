- Requests and external file as 
a string of text. 

- Any optional `options` key/value pairs
are passed to the request. 

- If the request succeeds, any find/replace
patterns from the optional `subs` argument
are applied. 

- A `template` element is then created. 

- The `.innerHTML` value of the template 
is set to the string. 

- The template is cloned to produce
a document fragment. 

- The document fragment is returned
in an object with an `ok` key (i.e.
`{ ok: DOCUMENT_FRAGMENT }`.

- If there's an error the return
value is at object 
with the bitty error 
(i.e. `{ error: BITTY_ERROR }`).
