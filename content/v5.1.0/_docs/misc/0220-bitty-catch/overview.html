<p>
Some events don't come from element and don't have
an approachable way to add a <code>data-send</code>
attribute to them (e.g. `.postMessage()`). These events
are captured by an optional <code>bittyCatch(event)</code>
method. It can be adjusted and used to trigger signals 
by using <code>this.api.forward()</code></p>
<p>Note that you'll probably need to do additional
    filtering. For example, if bitty is set up
    to listen for <code>click</code> events,
    it'll trigger for every one of them. 
    Not just for the ones associated with
    elements that have <code>data-send</code>
    on them</p>
