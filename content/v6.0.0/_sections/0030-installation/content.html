<h3>TL;DR</h3>

<p>This section walks through making this file.</p>

<div class="code-block-wrapper">
  <div class="code-block-title">page.html</div>
  <pre class="code-block"><code>
    [!- filter highlight_html|safe !]
[!- include version_dir + "/_sections/0030-installation/snippets/example-1.html" !]

<script>
  window.BittyClass = class {
[! include version_dir + "/_sections/0030-installation/snippets/example-1.js" !]
  }
</script>

<script src="/releases/[@- script_min_file_name -@]" type="module"></script>
    [!- endfilter !]
  </code></pre>
</div>

<h4>Next Steps</h4>

<p>
  The example in the overview used a <code>button</code> with
  a <code>data-send</code> attribute and a separate <code>div</code>
  with a <code>data-receive</code> attribute. Here, we're using
  a single button with both <code>data-send</code> and <code>data-receive</code>.
  No extra work is required for most elements to
  both send and receive the same signal. 
</p>

<p>
There are some cases (like [@ highlight_code('<input type="range">', "html")|safe @] elements)
where you have to add check to prevent feedback. <strong>bitty</strong>
provides helper funtions including one called <code>match</code>
to cover that. Check out the <code>Docs</code> sections
below for details. You can also check out the <code>Test Suite</code>.
Each test includes its source code that work as their own
examples as well.
