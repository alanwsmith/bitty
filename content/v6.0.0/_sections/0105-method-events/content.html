  <summary>Docs - Signal Method event Arguments</summary>
    <p>The methods that handle signals take two arguments: 1. the event
      that triggered the signal, and 2. an element that'
      receiving the signal. For example:<p>

    <div>
      <pre class="code-block-wrapper"><code>
        [!- filter highlight_javascript|safe !]
signalHandler(event, el) {
  el.innerHTML = "updated";
}
        [!- endfilter !]</code></pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      This section discusses
      the events. 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>bitty</strong> uses event listeners
        on the `window` object to catch events from signals. 
      </li>
      <li>The events passed to the methods are extended from 
        standard <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Events">DOM Events</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The event's `.target` property is the element that
        triggered the signal.
      </li>
      <li>Events from signals are modified to add a `.sender`
        property. The value is a reference to the element
        with the `data-send` attribute that sent the event. 
      </li>
      <li>If the element that triggered the signal has a
        `data-send` attribute, then it populates both the
        `.target` and `.sender` properties.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the element that triggered the signal does
        not have a `data-send` attribute, then it's
        only referenced in the `.target` property. 
        <strong>bitty</strong> goes up the DOM 
        searching for the nearest ancestor that
        has a `data-send` attribute. When it finds
        one, that element is used to populate
        the `.sender` property and the event is
        dispatched. 
      </li>

    </ul>
