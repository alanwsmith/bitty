  <summary>Docs - Signal Method element Arguments</summary>
    <p>The methods that handle signals take two arguments: 1. the event
      that triggered the signal, and 2. an element that's
      receiving the signal. For example,
      this method updates the `.innerHTML` content 
      of the element with the word `updated`:
    </p>

    <div>
      <pre class="code-block-wrapper"><code>
        [!- filter highlight_javascript|safe !]
signalHandler(event, el) {
  el.innerHTML = "updated";
}
        [!- endfilter !]</code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>The details on the elements are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Each element with a `data-receive` value
      that corresponds to the name of the method
        is sent through the method individually. 
      </li>
      <li>The elements are extended from standard <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element">HTML
        Elements</a> that you'd get from a querySelector.
      </li>

    </ul>


- TODO: Create a section for properties/methods
that are added to the elements that
are passed to the signal functions:

    - el.isSender

    - el.isTarget

    - el.bittyParent

    - el.bittyParentId

    - el.bittyId

    - el.getString(KEY) - 
    goes up the DOM looking for `data-key`
    Note that if you don't want to 
    traverse up you can always do
    `el.dataset.KEY` directly

    - el.getInt(KEY) - 
    goes up the DOM looking for `data-key`
    Note that if you don't want to 
    traverse up you can always do
    `el.dataset.KEY` directly

    - el.getFloat(KEY) - 
    goes up the DOM looking for `data-key`
    Note that if you don't want to 
    traverse up you can always do
    `el.dataset.KEY` directly
