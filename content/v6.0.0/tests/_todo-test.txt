# TODO Tests

- Make tests for:
`this.api.matchTarget()` and `this.api.matchSender()`
both with KEY names and without that uses `bittyid`
values. 


- Make sure to set trigger with multiple
signals e.g. `this.api.trigger("alfa bravo")` 

- Add tests for the getTXT() element, documnet
fragment, and array find replace subs that
mimic makeTXT(). 

- Add tests for the different getTHING() 
that mimic makeTHING()
