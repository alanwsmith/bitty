### Documentation To Add

- TODO: Create note on how the strings
from a given `data-*` can use `async/await`
but that doesn't work across elements. 

That is, if you do `data-send="await:runOne runTwo"`
The `await` will be used in each of the 
individual `<bitty-#-#>` elements but there
is no connection between them.
