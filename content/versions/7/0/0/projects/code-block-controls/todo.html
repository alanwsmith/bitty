## TODO

- Add the ability to turn off
the feature by adding a
`data-*` attribute (TBD
on the name)

- Set up the sizes so they
keep going. (right now
they are based off the
classes that are specific
to my CSS)

- Maybe refactor to use
a `data-selector` attribute to
define the CSS selector
that's used to look
for elements.
