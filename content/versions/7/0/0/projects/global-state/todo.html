## TODO

- Make an example showing how to use
a script tag on the page to load
a global state object with an
`.isReady()` method that bitty
elements to use to confirm data
is loaded (e.g. from localStorage
or a feed) beofre doing their thing. 

- use state.push(KEY) and state.pull(KEY) to 
work with the state via a switch
statement.

- for the state push and pull, if
you hit a key that doesn't exist,
don't throw an error. print a message 
the console instead.
