- [] Show using window.requestAnimationFrame to 
debounce input range sliders. 

- [] Show using `.isSender` to avoid feedback on 
sliders which doing something like applyStyle. 

- [] make a sample showing how to use makeTXT to create
a text list of options that can then be inserted
into a string for a select box to do that assemble
inside a larger template. 

- [] Also, show how to assemble it from parts. 

- [] Also show how to use subsitituion of 
arrays of elements and document fragments. 

- [] Show loading templates from external files
with `this.api.getTXT()` so you can do
find and replace them later with `this.api.makeHTML`.
The idea is you only have to load the templates
one time into an object the you can stamp out
as many as you need. (You could also just
keep the text templates directly in the JS
but sometimes it's nicer to separate them out.)

    Can even to stuff like make the filename
    the hash name and then just loop through them
    that want to pull them in.
