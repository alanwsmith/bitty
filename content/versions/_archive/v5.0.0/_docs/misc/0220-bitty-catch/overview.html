<p>
Some events don't come from element and don't have
an approachable way to add a <code>data-send</code>
attribute to them (e.g. `.postMessage()`). These events
are captured by an optional <code>bittyCatch(event)</code>
method. The can be adjusted and used to trigger signals 
by using <code>this.api.forward()</code></p>
