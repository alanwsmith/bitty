## Why Workshop

Answering the question:

<blockquote>
    Why do I even need this if I already know javascript?
</blockquote>

- working without a library/framework is a pain. 
you spend half your time connecting thing. 

- plain javascript is verbose which
slows everything down. 

- huge amounts of javascript is connection boilerplate
that connects events to elements with 
via listeners and selectors. bitty eliminates 
that work.
