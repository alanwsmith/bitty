<h2>TODO</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Maintain the size of the code
blocks when reducing the font
size so it doesn't move
out from under you. (TBD on
what to do when making the font
bigger. Thinking increasing
the size is better than adding
a scroll but need to play with
it. A CSS transition to
a larger size would probably
work nicely.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the ability to turn off
the feature on specific tags by adding a
<code>data-*</code> attribute (TBD
on the name).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set up the sizes so they
keep going (right now
they are based off the
classes that are specific
to my CSS).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe refactor to use
a <code>data-selector</code> attribute to
define the CSS selector
that's used to look
for elements. That would make
it more flexible. Not
something I need at the moment
though.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pass in <code>data-*</code> attributes
for things like the title
and file paths for the sample?
Or, look for a structute
surrounding a pre tag
that has that info in
it and include it
inside the control wrapper?
That approach would proablby
look for a specfic tag
on an element and then
look for <code class="code-span lang-html"><span class="line-marker"></span><span class="text html basic"><span class="meta tag block any html"><span class="punctuation definition tag begin html">&lt;</span><span class="entity name tag block any html">pre</span><span class="punctuation definition tag end html">&gt;</span></span></span></code> tags as the
starting point.</p>
</li>
</ul>
