<h2>TODO</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Add the ability to turn off
the feature on specific tags by adding a
<code>data-*</code> attribute (TBD
on the name).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set up the sizes so they
keep going (right now
they are based off the
classes that are specific
to my CSS).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe refactor to use
a <code>data-selector</code> attribute to
define the CSS selector
that's used to look
for elements. That would make
it more flexible. Not
something I need at the moment
though.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pass in <code>data-*</code> attributes
for things like the title
and file paths for the sample?
Or, look for a structute
surrounding a pre tag
that has that info in
it and include it
inside the control wrapper?
That approach would proablby
look for a specfic tag
on an element and then
look for <code class="code-span lang-html"><span class="line-marker"></span><span class="text html basic"><span class="meta tag block any html"><span class="punctuation definition tag begin html">&lt;</span><span class="entity name tag block any html">pre</span><span class="punctuation definition tag end html">&gt;</span></span></span></code> tags as the
starting point.</p>
</li>
