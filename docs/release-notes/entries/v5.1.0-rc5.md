### Version 5.1.0-rc5

Nov. 22, 2025

- Set up `this.api.trigger(SIGNAL)` to send event
that bubbles up to the document root

- Set up `this.api.forward(EVENT, SIGNAL)` to send event
that bubbles up to the document root

- Set up so `data-bittyid` attrs are added on 
connectedCallback instead of at each event 
call. 

- Set up so `data-bittyid` attrs are added
on `this.api.makeElement()`

- Set up so `data-bittyid` attrs are added
on `this.api.getElement()`

- Set up so `data-bittyid` attrs are added
on `this.api.makeHTML()`

- Set up so `data-bittyid` attrs are added
on `this.api.getHTML()`

- The net result is the `data-bittyid`
updates is that anything added with the `this.api.WHATEVER`
that has a `data-send`, `data-receive`,
or `data-init`, will have a `data-bittyid`
added. Anything
that's added outside the API won't, event
if it has one of the bitty `data-*` 
attributes. 

  (The prior behavior was to look query
  for elements with `data-*` attrs
  on every event. This was the first
  approach to deal with mutation 
  observer having a race condition
  when trying to add them. Doing
  everything explicitly through the
  API prevents thrashing for things like
  moving input range sliders)
