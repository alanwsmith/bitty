### Version: 6.0.0-rc3

DATE TBD

- Added `event.target.stringValue` the
returns the `event.target.value` as a string. 
(this is effectively an alias that's only here
to keep the mental model with `.intValue` and
`.floatValue` consistent)

- Added `event.target.intValue` the
returns the `event.target.value` as an
integer. 

- Added `event.target.floatValue` the
returns the `event.target.value` as an
float. 

- Added `event.sender.stringValue` the
returns the `event.sender.value` as a string. 
(this is effectively an alias that's only here
to keep the mental model with `.intValue` and
`.floatValue` consistent)

- Added `event.sender.intValue` the
returns the `event.sender.value` as an
integer. 

- Added `event.sender.floatValue` the
returns the `event.sender.value` as an
float. 

- Added `event.target.getString(KEY)`

- Added `event.target.getInt(KEy)`

- Added `event.target.getFloat(KEY)`

- Added `event.sender.getString(KEY)`

- Added `event.sender.getInt(KEY)`

- Added `event.sender.getFloat(KEY)`

- Added `el.matchTarget(KEY)`
Note that there is no string/int/float because
the values are always stored as strings
so the comparison doesn't have to convert
them since it would just be the same
thing anyway

- Added `el.matchSender(KEY)`
Note that there is no string/int/float because
the values are always stored as strings
so the comparison doesn't have to convert
them since it would just be the same
thing anyway

- Remove setting `style="display: block;"`.
Leaving this as a decision at implementation time.
