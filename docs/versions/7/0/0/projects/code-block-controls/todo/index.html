<h2>TODO</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Add the ability to turn off
the feature by adding a
<code>data-*</code> attribute (TBD
on the name)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set up the sizes so they
keep going. (right now
they are based off the
classes that are specific
to my CSS)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe refactor to use
a <code>data-selector</code> attribute to
define the CSS selector
that's used to look
for elements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pass in <code>data-*</code> attributes
for things like the title
and file paths for the sample.</p>
</li>
</ul>
